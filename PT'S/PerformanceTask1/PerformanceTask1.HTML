  <ul>
  <li>Light Detection: The eye's outermost layer, the cornea, focuses incoming light. It then passes through the pupil, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, similar to the aperture of a camera.</li>
<li>  Focusing Light: The lens further focuses the light onto the retina, a light-sensitive layer at the back of the eyeball.</li>
  <li>Converting Light to Signals: The retina contains millions of photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. These cells convert the focused light into electrical signals. Rods are more sensitive to low light and provide night vision, while cones are responsible for color vision and work best in bright light.</li>
<li>  Sending Signals to the Brain: The electrical signals generated by the retina travel through the optic nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as visual information. This allows us to perceive the world around us in terms of color, shape, movement, and depth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>  Here are some additional details about the eye's structure and functions:</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>  Parts of the Eye: The eye consists of several important parts, including the cornea, pupil, iris, lens, retina, optic nerve, and various muscles that control eye movement.</li>
 <li> Binocular Vision: Humans have two eyes positioned slightly apart, which provides us with binocular vision. This allows us to perceive depth and distance more accurately.</li>
<li>  Accommodation: The lens in the eye can adjust its shape to focus on objects at different distances, a process called accommodation.</li>
<li>
  Eye Health: Maintaining good eye health is crucial for optimal vision. Regular eye exams are important to detect and address any potential problems.
